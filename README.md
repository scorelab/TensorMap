# TensorMap

TensorMap is a web application that will allow the users to create machine learning algorithms visually. TensorMap supports reverse engineering of the visual layout to a Tensorflow implementation in preferred languages. The goal of the project is to let the beginners play with machine learning algorithms in Tensorflow without less background knowledge about the library.
